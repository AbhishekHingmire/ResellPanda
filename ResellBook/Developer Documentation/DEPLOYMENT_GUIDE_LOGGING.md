## üèóÔ∏è **Deployment Steps**

### Why Use Our Custom Deployment Scripts? ü§î

**‚ùå Manual Deployment Commands Problems:**
- `dotnet publish` + Visual Studio publish can **OVERWRITE wwwroot folder**
- Risk of **losing user-uploaded book images** and existing files
- No automatic backup/restore mechanism
- Complex manual steps with potential for human error

**‚úÖ Our Custom Scripts Benefits:**
- **Preserve wwwroot folder** containing user uploads and static files
- **Preserve AppLogs directory** that will contain our new logging files
- Automated deployment process with built-in safety checks
- Proper Azure CLI integration with resource group management
- Automated cleanup of temporary files

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Verification
```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd "c:\Repos\ResellPanda\ResellBook"

# Verify THE deployment script exists (critical safety check)
if (!(Test-Path "deploy.ps1")) {
    Write-Host "‚ùå DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT MISSING - DO NOT DEPLOY!" -ForegroundColor Red
    exit 1
}

# Clean and rebuild to verify no issues
dotnet clean
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Verify no build errors before deployment
```

**üìã Quick Reference:** See `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for a faster checklist format.

### Step 2: Deploy Using BULLETPROOF Script (REQUIRED)

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: After the image loss incident, ONLY use this script:

#### **OFFICIAL DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT (ONLY SAFE OPTION)**
```powershell
# üõ°Ô∏è THE ONLY DEPLOYMENT COMMAND YOU SHOULD EVER USE:
.\deploy.ps1
```

**Why this is the ONLY script you should use:**
‚úÖ **File Safety**: NEVER loses user images or uploads  
‚úÖ **Proven Safe**: Uses Azure CLI source deployment (preserves wwwroot)  
‚úÖ **Smart Backup**: Creates timestamped backup folders automatically  
‚úÖ **Clean Deployment**: Excludes wwwroot from deployment package  
‚úÖ **Auto-Testing**: Tests application endpoints after deployment  
‚úÖ **Manual Verification**: Provides steps to verify file preservation  
‚úÖ **Battle-Tested**: Successfully deployed without losing any files

#### **üö® NEVER USE THESE (REMOVED FOR SAFETY):**
```powershell
# ‚ùå OLD SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN DELETED TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS:
# deploy-simple-preserve.ps1        # REMOVED - was losing images
# deploy-advanced-preserve.ps1      # REMOVED - unreliable  
# deploy-preserve-wwwroot.ps1       # REMOVED - dangerous
# deploy-bulletproof-safe.ps1       # REMOVED - had auth issues

# ‚ùå MANUAL METHODS THAT DELETE FILES:
# az webapp deploy --type zip       # DESTRUCTIVE - replaces entire site
# dotnet publish + Visual Studio    # OVERWRITES wwwroot completely
# Manual file upload via portal     # INCONSISTENT and risky
```

#### **‚úÖ SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH:**
```powershell
# THERE IS ONLY ONE DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT NOW:
.\deploy.ps1

# If this file doesn't exist, DO NOT DEPLOY - contact the team immediately!
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
The script will show progress:
```
üöÄ Simple deployment preserving wwwroot...
üî® Building application...
üì¶ Preparing deployment package...
üìã Copying files (excluding wwwroot)...
üóúÔ∏è Creating deployment zip...
‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to Azure (wwwroot will be preserved)...
üßπ Cleaning up...
‚úÖ Deployment completed! wwwroot folder preserved.
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Critical - What Gets Preserved:**
```
Production Server (SAFE with our scripts):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wwwroot/                    # ‚úÖ PRESERVED
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BookImages/            # ‚úÖ User uploads preserved  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserFiles/             # ‚úÖ Any user content preserved
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AppLogs/               # ‚úÖ Our new logging directory preserved
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ normal.txt         # Will be created by SimpleLogger
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ critical.txt       # Will be created by SimpleLogger
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è What Manual `dotnet publish` Would Do:**
- ‚ùå **DELETE entire wwwroot folder** (losing all book images)
- ‚ùå **DELETE all user uploads**
- ‚ùå **DELETE existing AppLogs** (if any)
- ‚ùå **Require re-uploading all user content**

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification
Test these endpoints immediately after deployment:

```bash
# 1. Health Check
curl https://resellbook20250929183655.azurewebsites.net/api/Test/ping

# 2. Test Logging System
curl https://resellbook20250929183655.azurewebsites.net/api/Logs/TestLogging

# 3. Verify ViewAll Fix (the original issue)
curl "https://resellbook20250929183655.azurewebsites.net/api/Books/ViewAll?userId=02b994fb-9c5d-4c38-9ce7-8b91c3e9e298"

# 4. Check Logs Summary
curl https://resellbook20250929183655.azurewebsites.net/api/Logs/GetLogsSummary
```

## üîç **Deployment Verification**

### Expected Results Post-Deployment:

#### 1. ViewAll Endpoint ‚úÖ
**Before:** 500 Internal Server Error
**After:** 200 OK with book data
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [/* book array */],
  "count": 4
}
```

#### 2. Logging Endpoints ‚úÖ
- `/api/Logs/GetLogsSummary` ‚Üí Returns log counts
- `/api/Logs/GetNormalLogs` ‚Üí Returns operation logs
- `/api/Logs/GetCriticalLogs` ‚Üí Returns error logs
- `/api/Logs/TestLogging` ‚Üí Creates test logs

#### 3. Error Handling ‚úÖ
All exceptions now logged to critical.txt with full stack traces

---

## üìä **Monitoring Setup**

### Key Metrics to Monitor Post-Deployment:
1. **ViewAll Endpoint Success Rate**: Should be 100% (was failing before)
2. **Log File Growth**: Monitor AppLogs directory size
3. **Critical Log Frequency**: Should decrease significantly
4. **Response Times**: Should improve with better error handling

### Application Insights Queries:
```kusto
// Monitor ViewAll endpoint success
requests 
| where url contains "ViewAll"
| summarize SuccessRate = avg(toint(success)) by bin(timestamp, 1h)

// Track critical errors
traces 
| where severityLevel >= 3
| summarize ErrorCount = count() by bin(timestamp, 1h)
```

---

## üö® **Rollback Plan**

If issues occur, rollback steps:

### Quick Rollback (if needed):
1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous deployment via Azure portal
2. **Code Level**: Temporarily comment out logging calls
3. **Emergency**: Disable LogsController endpoints

### Files to Rollback (Priority Order):
1. `Controllers/BooksController.cs` (ViewAll method)
2. `Controllers/LogsController.cs` (new logging endpoints)
3. `Utils/SimpleLogger.cs` (logging utility)

### Why Our Scripts Are Superior for Rollback:
- **Preserve user data**: Book images in wwwroot stay intact during rollback
- **Preserve logs**: Our AppLogs directory won't be lost during rollback
- **Automated process**: One command rollback vs manual steps

---

## üîß **Production Configuration**

### Environment-Specific Settings:
```json
// appsettings.Production.json additions (if needed)
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "ResellBook.Controllers": "Information"
    }
  },
  "LoggingSettings": {
    "MaxLogFileSize": "50MB",
    "LogRetentionDays": 30,
    "EnableFileLogging": true
  }
}
```

### IIS/Azure App Service Settings:
- Ensure write permissions to `AppLogs` directory
- Monitor disk space usage
- Set up log rotation if needed

---

## üìã **Post-Deployment Tasks**

### Immediate (0-2 hours):
- [x] Verify all endpoints respond correctly
- [x] Test ViewAll with different user IDs
- [x] Confirm logging system creates files
- [x] Check Application Insights for errors

### Short-term (1-7 days):
- [ ] Monitor log file growth patterns
- [ ] Analyze critical log frequency
- [ ] Performance testing of ViewAll endpoint
- [ ] User feedback collection

### Medium-term (1-4 weeks):
- [ ] Implement log rotation strategy
- [ ] Set up automated alerts
- [ ] Performance optimization if needed
- [ ] Documentation updates based on usage
